## Changes in 2.2.0

* Add Support for Janus ActiveRecord adapters. Thanks to @permidon via #\873.

## Changes in 2.1.0

### New Features

* Add Support for `active_record_proxy_adapters` gem thanks to @stingrayzboy via #\867.
  Since Rails 7.1 makara no longer works and it is not currently maintained. The @nasdaq team
  have written a gem called [active_record_proxy_adapters](https://rubygems.org/gems/active_record_proxy_adapters)
  that implements some makara functionality.

## Changes in 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Fix `recursive_on_duplicate_key_update` doesn't work with non-standard
  association name. Thanks to @jacob-carlborg-apoex via \#852. The documentation for the
  `:recursive_on_duplicate_key_update` option specifies that the hash key is
  the association name. But previously the name of associated table was used to
  look up the options. Now the behavior matches the documentation and the name
  of the association is used instead. This only affects associations that uses
  a name that doesn't follow the ActiveRecord naming conventions of
  associations and class names, i.e. when the `class_name:` option is used on
  an association.
